# Fundamental of Azure part 2

### Points to remember

1. Difference between public, private and hybrid cloud

| Public        | Private           | Hybrid  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| No capital expenditures to scale up.      | Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance. | most flexibity |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.    | Organizations have complete control over resources and security.      |   Organizations determine where to run their applications.   |
| Organizations pay only for what they use. |  Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates. |    Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.|

2. Advantages of cloud computing
    * High availability: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

    * Scalability: Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:

        1. Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
        2. Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.

    * Elasticity: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.

    * Agility: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

    * Geo-distribution: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

    * Disaster recovery: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

3. Expenses that need to be considered: capital and operational(better as cloud is OpEx)
