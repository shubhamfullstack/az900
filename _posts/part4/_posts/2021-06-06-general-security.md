# Security

### Azure Security Center

1. Azure Security Center is a monitoring service that provides visibility of your security posture across all of your services, both on Azure and on-premises. The term security posture refers to cybersecurity policies and controls, as well as how well you can predict, prevent, and respond to security threats.

2. Secure score is a measurement of an organization's security posture.

### Azure Sentinel

1. Security management on a large scale can benefit from a dedicated security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system aggregates security data from many different sources (as long as those sources support an open-standard logging format). It also provides capabilities for threat detection and response.

* Collect cloud data at scale
* Detect previously undetected threats
* Investigate threats with artificial intelligence
* Respond to incidents rapidly

### Key Vault

1. Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application's secrets in a single, central location. It provides secure access to sensitive information by providing access control and logging capabilities.

* Manage secrets
* Manage encryption keys
* Manage SSL/TLS certificates
* Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)

### Azure Dedicated VM

1. Some organizations must follow regulatory compliance that requires them to be the only customer using the physical machine that hosts their virtual machines. Azure Dedicated Host provides dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux.
