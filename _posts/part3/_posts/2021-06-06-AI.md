# AI Services

1. Two Approaches
    * Deep Learning - that's modeled on the neural network of the human mind, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.
    * Machine Learning - a data science technique that uses existing data to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

### Azure Machine Learning

1. Azure Machine Learning is a platform for making predictions. It consists of tools and services that allow you to connect to data to train and test models to find one that will most accurately predict a future result. 

### Azure Cognitive Services

1. provides prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason. 

2. Services can be divided into:
    * Language 
    * Speech
    * Vision
    * Decisions

### Azure Bot Service

1. Bot Framework are platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to questions just like a human. 

2. Bots can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that might no longer require direct human intervention
