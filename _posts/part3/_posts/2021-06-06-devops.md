### Github and Github Actions

1. If you're building open-source software, you would likely choose GitHub if for no other reasons than its visibility and general acceptance by the open-source development community.

### Azure DevTest Labs

1. Azure DevTest Labs provides an automated means of managing the process of building, setting up, and tearing down virtual machines (VMs) that contain builds of your software projects. 

2. Suppose you need to test a new feature on an old version of an operating system. Azure DevTest Labs can set up everything automatically upon request.
