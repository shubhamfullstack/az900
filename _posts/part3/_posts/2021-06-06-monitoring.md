# Monitoring Services

### Azure Advisor

1. Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs. Advisor is designed to help you save time on cloud optimization. 

### Azure Monitor

1. Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and potentially taking action based on the metric and logging data from your entire Azure and on-premises environment.

### Azure Service Health

1. Azure Service Health provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services, regions, and resources you rely on. The status.azure.com website, which displays only major issues that broadly affect Azure customers, doesn't provide the full picture. 

* Service issues are problems in Azure, such as outages, that affect you right now.
* Planned maintenance events can affect your availability.
* Health advisories are issues that require you to act to avoid service interruption
