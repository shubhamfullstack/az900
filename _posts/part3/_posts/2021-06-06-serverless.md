# Serverless Services

1. serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment. The term serverless computing is a misnomer. After all, there is a server (or a group of servers) that executes your code or desired functionality.

### Azure Functions

1. you can host a single method or function by using a popular programming language in the cloud that runs in response to an event. An example of an event might be an HTTP request, a new message on a queue, or a message on a timer.

2. C#, Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, and PowerShell.

### Logic Apps

1. Logic Apps is a low-code/no-code development platform hosted as a cloud service. The service helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations. 

### Differences

1. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, and Azure Logic Apps is intended to be a serverless orchestration service.

2. Do you prefer a visual (declarative) workflow or writing (imperative) code?
Ultimately, your choice comes down to whether you prefer to work in a declarative environment or an imperative environment. Developers who have expertise in an imperative programming language might prefer to think about automation and orchestration from an imperative mindset. IT professionals and business analysts might prefer to work in a more visual low-code/no-code (declarative) environment.
