# Fundamental of Azure part 4

### Points to remember

1. Availability zones are created by using one or more datacenters. There's a minimum of three zones within a single region. It's possible that a large disaster could cause an outage big enough to affect even two datacenters. That's why Azure also creates region pairs.

2. If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within it are also deleted. Organizing resources by life cycle can be useful in nonproduction environments, where you might try an experiment and then dispose of it. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources all at once.

3. Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions.
4. Resource Group: Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.

5. 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level. Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.Each management group can have many children. All subscriptions and management groups are within a single hierarchy in each directory.

6. Subscription:  logical unit of Azure services that links to an Azure account?
